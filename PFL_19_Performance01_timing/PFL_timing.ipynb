    "# Python for Lunch (PFL) - Performance Sessions - Time & Time Measurements \n",
    "\n",
    "# _What on Earth is wrong with Time ?_ \n",
    "\n",
    "This *Python for Lunch (PFL)* series shall introduce you, as the audience, to some general concepts in performance optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Performance optimisation* in programming tries to answer the simple question: \n",
    "**How can I improve the design and code of my program so it performs its tasks as rapidly and efficiently as possible, \n",
    "given the modern hardware capabilities available to me ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In popular and social discussions with *technology enthusiasts*, some people of you may have heard already terms such as \n",
    "*GPU Computing*, *Vectorisation* and the use of *(Just-in-Time) C-Kernels*, in the context of improving the performance \n",
    "of (Python) programs. How could you make use of those technologies ? Also, and more importantly, does it even make sense \n",
    "to investigate how to use those technologies (i.e. techniques) for your application ? Those are the kind of questions we \n",
    "want to answer in this PFL series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before actually doing some performance optimisation, we first need to understand how we can measure the performance of \n",
    "our current program. It's like writing a scientific article: having a fancy new idea is nice, but \n",
    "you first need to investigate the current state of research before pointing out which gap is being addressed by your \n",
    "new idea. In the realm of *high-performance computing (HPC)* and software programs, performance is measured by the passing\n",
    "of *time* for executing a piece of code (i.e. program runtime). As we will see today, what sounds so simple (i.e. *measuring time*) \n",
    "can actually be quite difficult, if done correctly, and is often done incorrectly outside the computer sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time and the *reference frame*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start of by doing a few little thought experiments on time. In the first case, we imagine we sit at our desk and we get a \n",
    "notification that a new MS Teams meeting is starting in 10 minutes. This notification is is fairly unambiguous: you can set an alarm\n",
    "on your watch for in-10-minutes. These 10 minutes refer to the passing of our real-world time, so for a digital watch - no matter\n",
    "on which device it runs, if it is networked or used my millions of people - we expect it to behave just as our manual wrist watch. In\n",
    "other terms, we have an *absolute reference frame* here - which is the real-world UTC time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another case of time is the communication between GPS satellites and their GPS base stations: Both the base stations as well as\n",
    "the satellite are running high-precision clocks and exchange to time measurements in high-precision in a satellite message. The\n",
    "base stations (as: our end-user devices) receive the *time-pings* from the satellite. Base on the time difference between the \n",
    "satellite ping and the local clock, together with the base station triangulation, we can calculate the (triangular, barycentric)\n",
    "position of any receiver. The time measurements in this case are in a *relative reference frame* - time passing relative to the \n",
    "satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can encounter another relative reference frame in daily life in the train: When you board the train, it shows you on the digital\n",
    "dashboard the travel time from you current- to your target location. During the travel, several delays can occur, suchs as\n",
    "congestion, rail change, and so forth. When you arrive at your target destimation, and you measured the real-world time passed\n",
    "for the travel, then the latter measurement will be larger than what was initially displayed. Now, the question is: what was the\n",
    "actual travel time ? Was it the real-world time passing between you boarding the train and you arriving, or the accumulated time(steps)\n",
    "the train was actually _moving_ on rails toward the destination ? This latter measurement is also a relative reference frame - a\n",
    "time measurement that is relative to the motion of the train. And this case is also similar to what we encounter in computing when\n",
    "measuring time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our introduction example: How to measure 100ms on a computer ?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a starting point in measuring time, we start off with a simple task:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Measure the passing of a 100ms during code execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "This task seems mundane, perhaps very abstract, as you can say: well, I just start a counter, put my program to sleep \n",
    "for 0.1 second, and then take the counter again - and 100ms have passed! \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, this is _not_ the case. It's the difference between *defining* PI in a program via its calculator value (i.e. 3.141592654) \n",
    "and *calculating* PI via Monte Carlo sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following function code measure the passing of 100ms using two (seamingly different) timing modes, by doing the following:\n",
    "- run a global loop to measure 10 sec (to be resilient to measurement outliers)\n",
    "- within that global loop, obtain a start time *t(0)*\n",
    "- check if the difference between the current time *t(x)* and the start time *t(0)* is greater-or-equal-to 0.1s\n",
    "- if that is the case, the current time becomes the end measurement *t(n)*\n",
    "- we compute *delta(t(n), t(0))*, which is then ideally exactly 0.1s\n",
    "- for the next measurement cycle, we set *t(0) = t(n)*\n",
    "- for statistical evaluation, we log *delta(t(n), t(0))*\n",
    "- if *t(x) - t(0) < 0.1s*, we do nothing (i.e. we wait for a fraction of 100ms before checking again)\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected outcome of this test:\n",
    "- *delta(t(n), t(0))* is always exactly 0.1s\n",
    "- *delta(t(n), t(0))* is always the same, for both timing modes and all individual 100ms-intervals"

    "- *compute vs. io* >> 1.0: high computation density - lots of benefit from C-kernel computation or GPU Computing\n",
    "- *compute vs. io* >= 1.0: if I/O and CPU load are balanced, improved memory access procedures are the first-most advice to improve performance\n",
    "- 1.0 < *compute vs. io* < 0.1: main bottleneck culprit is memory - likely many *copy-array1-to-array2* operations, of which some may be unnecessary ? Improve memory utilisation by avoiding unnecessary copies\n",
    "- *compute vs. io* < 0.1 **or** *compute vs. io* << 0.1: main bottleneck (due to the orders of magnitude difference) has to be file-, database- or network communication. The code needs to optimize file access, only load required subset data and also buffer-write results into files. **Investing time in C-kernels, GPU Computing, Vectorisation or similar compute-enhancing techniques is a waste of time for simulations in this bracket!!**\n"
