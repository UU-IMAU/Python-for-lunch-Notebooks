# Seminar on: Jupyter notebook examples
Anneke's example demonstrates these concepts:
* plotting
* functions
* timing of individual cells
* Parcels


Leo's example demonstrates these concepts:
* load NetCDF using Xarray
* Matplotlib / Cartopy plotting
* loading external .py files using autoreload, so that any changes take effect immediately.

All of these concepts will be discussed in more detail later on.
